/**
 * Achievements core functions
 *
 * The architecture of Achievements is straightforward, making use of custom post types,
 * statuses, and taxonomies (no custom tables or SQL queries). Custom rewrite rules and
 * endpoints are used to register and display templates, but this file primarily takes
 * care of the core logic -- when a user does something, how does that trigger an event
 * and award an achievement?
 *
 * The achievement post type has a taxonomy called dpa_event. An "event" is any
 * do_action in WordPress. An achievement post is assigned a term from that taxonomy.
 *
 * On every page load, we grab all terms from the dpa_event taxonomy that have been
 * associated with a post. The dpa_handle_event() function is then registered with
 * those actions, and that's what lets us detect when something interesting happens.
 *
 * dpa_handle_event() makes a WP_Query query of the achievement post type, passing
 * the name of the current action (aka event) as the "tax_query" parameter. This is
 * because multiple achievements could use the same event and we need details of each
 * of those achievements. At this point, we know that the user has maybe unlocked an
 * achievement.
 *
 * The aptly named dpa_maybe_unlock_achievement() function takes over. An achievement
 * has a criteria of how many times an event has to occur (in post meta) for a user
 * before that achievement is unlocked. If the criteria has not been met, then a
 * record of the progress is stored in another custom post type, dpa_progress. If the
 * criteria was met, the dpa_progress post's status is changed to "unlocked".
 *
 * Each achievement has points (in post meta) and those are added to the user's score
 * (in user meta). The user is then made aware that they've unlocked an achievement.
