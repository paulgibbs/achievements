Achievements gamifies your WordPress site with challenges, badges, and points.

== Description ==

Achievements gamifies your WordPress site with challenges, badges, and points. Badges and points are the funnest way to reward and encourage members of your community to participate. Leaderboards and rankings bring friendly competition to your community.

Simply by activating Achievements, any standard WordPress theme is suddenly capable of having achievements and tracking user progress; everything works out of the box. Achievements integrates seamlessly with your existing WordPress theme.

This plugin supports many of your favourite WordPress plugins, including [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bbpress/), [BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress/), [BuddyStream](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddystream/), [coursewa.re](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-courseware/), [Invite Anyone](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/invite-anyone/), and [WP e-Commerce](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-e-commerce/). For example, have you ever wanted to give your community members points when they contribute to a discussion, or buy items from your store? Now you can.
